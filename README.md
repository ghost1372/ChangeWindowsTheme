# ChangeWindowsTheme
 Automatically change Windows theme to dark or light

This is a fast and efficient native C++ application that automatically detects the current Windows theme (light or dark) and switches it to the opposite theme. The app operates in the background without any visible console or window, making it unobtrusive and ideal for users who prefer seamless theme switching.
